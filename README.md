# Onshape Design Repository

Welcome to the Onshape Design Repository â€“ a curated collection of 3D CAD models created using `Onshape`, ranging from beginner-friendly designs to complex mechanical assemblies, with a special focus on robotics components and systems.

Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or robotics enthusiast, this repository is designed to help you:

- Understand parametric modeling basics

- Learn best practices in CAD

- Explore real-world mechanical parts used in robotics

## Getting Started

- Browse the folders based on your interest or skill level

- Click on any folder to access the associated Onshape link or download exported files

- Use or modify the design in your own projects

## Focus on Robotics

This repo includes robotics-centric designs such as:

- Actuator mechanisms

- Arm and gripper assemblies

- Sensor mounts and integration systems

- These are especially useful for teams in:
 
- Robotics competitions (e.g., FRC, FTC, RoboCup)
 
- DIY automation projects

- Simulation or prototyping stages of embedded systems

## Contributions

While this is a personal design journal, collaborators are welcome to suggest improvements, new design ideas, or share their Onshape models for inclusion.
